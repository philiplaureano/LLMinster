# LLMinster: The Developer's LLM Client

**LLMinster** is an open-source project that aims to make it easier for developers to integrate and interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and more. 

This repository will be the home for **LLMinster's core functionality**, providing a foundation for building powerful and extensible LLM-powered applications. 

## Project Status:  Early Development (Phase 0 and Phase 1)

We're currently in the early stages of development, focusing on building a robust and user-friendly command-line client. 

**Current Progress:**

- **Phase 0 (Completed):** We've built a basic command-line chat client that demonstrates the core functionality of LLMinster, including streaming responses from ChatGPT. You can find the demo script in the [examples](/examples) directory.

## Technology Stack:

- .NET 8 (C#)
- SQLite Database
- OpenAI API (for now)
- `fsEnsemble` LLM Library (our custom library for simplifying LLM interactions)
